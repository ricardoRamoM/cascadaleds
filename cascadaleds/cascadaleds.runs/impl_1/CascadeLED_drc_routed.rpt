2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net LEDS_reg[10]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin LEDS_reg[10]/L3_2/O, cell LEDS_reg[10]/L3_2 (in LEDS_reg[10] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net LEDS_reg[11]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin LEDS_reg[11]/L3_2/O, cell LEDS_reg[11]/L3_2 (in LEDS_reg[11] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net LEDS_reg[12]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin LEDS_reg[12]/L3_2/O, cell LEDS_reg[12]/L3_2 (in LEDS_reg[12] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
